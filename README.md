# Simple React/Next.js Developer Assignment

## Objective
Create a dynamic, responsive web application using React or Next.js that demonstrates your proficiency in modern frontend development.

## Requirements

1. Application Structure:
   - Implement a single-page application (SPA) with at least 3 main pages/routes:
     - Home page
     - Article list page
     - Article detail page

2. Data Fetching:
   - Use a public API (e.g., NewsAPI, Medium API) to fetch article data.
   - Implement proper error handling and loading states.

3. State Management:
   - Use React hooks (useState, useEffect) for local state management.
   - Implement global state management using Context API or Redux (optional).

4. Routing:
   - Implement client-side routing using React Router (for React) or Next.js built-in routing.

5. Components:
   - Create reusable components for common elements (e.g., Article Card, Navigation, Footer).
   - Implement at least one custom hook.

6. Styling:
   - Use CSS modules, styled-components, or any CSS-in-JS solution.
   - Ensure the application is responsive and works well on mobile devices.

7. Performance:
   - Implement lazy loading for images.
   - Use React.memo or useMemo for performance optimization where appropriate.

8. Testing:
   - Write unit tests for at least two components using Jest and React Testing Library.

9. Additional Features (choose at least one):
   - Implement infinite scrolling on the article list page.
   - Add a search functionality to filter articles.
   - Implement a dark mode toggle.

## Bonus Points
- Use TypeScript for type checking.
- Implement server-side rendering (if using Next.js).
- Add end-to-end tests using Cypress or Playwright.
- Implement a simple CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions.

## Submission Guidelines
- Create a new GitHub repository for your project.
- Include a README.md with:
  - Project setup instructions
  - Brief explanation of your technical choices
  - Any assumptions or trade-offs made
- Commit your code regularly to show your development process.
- Deploy your application to a free hosting service (e.g., Vercel, Netlify).

## Evaluation Criteria
- Code quality and organization
- Component design and reusability
- State management implementation
- Routing implementation
- API integration and error handling
- Responsive design and UI/UX considerations
- Performance optimizations
- Testing coverage and quality
- Additional features implementation (if any)
